DEVELOPER INTERN EXERCISE
-------------------------

I have coded the two assignments in java and included the ecplise project for the same.
The java version used is JavaSE 1.6.


Question 1:
-----------

Create an app that will be executed in terminal or from the command line. The app should accept a hashtag as an argument and should only print out unique urls found in the 100 most recent tweets that matched the hashtag.

To execute from command line: java -jar UniqueTweets.jar 

Source code: ./McKinsey/src/UniqueTweets.java
Additional packages used: org.json (http://www.json.org/) for tokenizing and parsing the twitter search API response.

	
Question 2:
-----------
Given an array of integers, write some code to find all the integers that appear more than once in the array, sorted by which appears most often to least often (once)

To execute from command line: java -jar CountIntegers.jar
Source code: ./McKinsey/src/CountIntegers.java
